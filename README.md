# Spatiotemporal Attention and Decision Making

This repository contains figures and analyses for the manuscript: Linear and Nonlinear Effects of Spatial and 
Temporal Attention: Human Data and Drift Diffusion Model. 

 to a Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) exploring how spatio
attention influences decision-making behavior. The code is written in Python and Jupyter Notebooks, and includes model fitting, 
visualization, and statistical analysis.
